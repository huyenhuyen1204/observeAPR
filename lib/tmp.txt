Matching The clusters in our approach are the equivalence classes of a matching relation. We say that two programs P and Q match, written P âˆ¼ Q, when: (1) they have the same control-flow (see the discussion below), and (2) there is a total bijective relation between the variables of P and Q, such that related variables take the same values, in the same order, during the program execution on the same inputs. This is inspired by the notion of a simulation relation [28], adapted for a dynamic program analysis: whereas a simulation relation establishes that a program P produces exactly the same values as program Q at corresponding program locations for all inputs, we are interested only in a fixed finite set of inputs. Therefore, we also call this notion dynamic equivalence, to stress that we use dynamic program analysis.
